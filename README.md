# genetic-Feature-selection

Objectives
This objective of this work is to reduces dimensional problems of Bengali text classifier. Our proposed model is supposed to reduces the problem described previous section. Our defined procedures are supposed to reduce most of the problems. Summary of the objectives:
	
  Reduces dimensional problems of Bengali text classifier. 
	Build more efficient hybrid model to feature selection.
	Introduced enhanced GA for features optimization.
	Select optimum number of features for classifier.
	Make a classifier model that is more accurate than before.
